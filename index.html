                    <p> My goal is to change the world of small business through affordable, real world software solutions. If I put more text here, would it look better? One more sentence. Maybe I need a logo, or put the picture somewhere else. Hmm design is hard.</p>

                    <h4>A little bit about me.</h4>
                    <p>I've had a few careers in my life. Most recently, for the last 13 years, I have been a barista and have managed a small buisiness coffee shope for the last 4. In that time, there have been many times that I  have said of our current software applications, "I wish it did ----", so I have jumped into the world of software development to make my wishes into reality.</p> 
                    <h4>Current Projects</h4>
                    <p> I'm trying to teach myself how to make a button work with JavaScript, soooooo</p>
